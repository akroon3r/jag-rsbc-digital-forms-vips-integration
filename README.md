run in order (wait for stage to come up before starting the next):
```shell script
docker-compose -f nexus-docker-compose.yml up --build
docker-compose up --build
```
Or
```
mvn clean install -Pdefault-profile
mvn package -Pdefault-profile
mvn spring-boot:run    
```  

* In STS4, launch the **digitalforms-api** from the Boot Dashboard.
